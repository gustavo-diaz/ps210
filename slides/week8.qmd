TBD

## So far

- Course mostly about **statistical** and **causal inference**

- **This week:** Small N or qualitative methods

- **Tuesday:** Reservations with large N + logic of causation

- [**Thursday:**](#thu) Techniques 

## Questions

What have you learned so far?

. . .

Any reservations with the methods we have discussed?

. . .

Any other methods you would like to learn about?

## Back to regression: QoG 2024

```{r, results = "hide"}
url = 'https://www.qogdata.pol.gu.se/data/qog_std_cs_jan24.csv'

qog = read.csv(url)

# examine but don't print in pdf
qog_am = qog %>% 
  select(cname,
         mortinf = wdi_mortinf,
         water = who_dwtot,
         elec = wdi_acel) %>% 
  drop_na()
```


```{r}
p = ggplot(qog_am) +
  aes(x = water, y = mortinf, label = cname) +
  geom_text(size = 4 ) +
  labs(
    x = "% Access to Clean Water",
    y = "Infant Mortality\n(per 1,000 births)"
  )

p
```

## Fit regression

```{r}
p + geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = nu_purple)
```


## More questions

::: incremental
- Can we claim *access to clean water* **reduces** *infant mortality*?

- What do we need to believe?

- Random assignment? Conditional independence? Quasi-experiment?

:::

. . .

**Critique 1:** *Correlation does not imply causation*

. . .

We need more knowledge to make causal claims

## Remove Turkmenistan

```{r}
p + geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = nu_purple)
```

## Remove Turkmenistan

```{r}
ggplot(qog_am %>% filter(cname != "Turkmenistan")) +
  aes(x = water, y = mortinf, label = cname) +
  geom_text(size = 4 ) +
  labs(
    x = "% Access to Clean Water",
    y = "Infant Mortality\n(per 1,000 births)"
  ) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = nu_purple)
```

## Remove high infant mortality

```{r}
ggplot(qog_am %>% filter(cname != "Turkmenistan")) +
  aes(x = water, y = mortinf, label = cname) +
  geom_text(size = 4 ) +
  labs(
    x = "% Access to Clean Water",
    y = "Infant Mortality\n(per 1,000 births)"
  ) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = nu_purple)
```

## Remove high infant mortality

```{r}
ggplot(qog_am %>% filter(cname != "Turkmenistan" &
                           mortinf <= 50)) +
  aes(x = water, y = mortinf, label = cname) +
  geom_text(size = 4 ) +
  labs(
    x = "% Access to Clean Water",
    y = "Infant Mortality\n(per 1,000 births)"
  ) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = nu_purple) +
  ylim(0, 80)
```

## More more questions

. . .

Let's say you believe this relationship is causal

::: incremental
- How is it that one thing causes the other?

- Direction of causality?

- Is this true everywhere?

- Are we comparing apples and apples or apples and oranges and pick-up trucks?
:::

. . .

**Critique 2:** _Large N findings are what happens **on average**_

. . .

Averages are sensitive to **sample composition**

## Another way to think about it

```{r}
p
```

## Another way to think about it

```{r}
p + annotate("rect", fill = nu_purple, alpha = 0.2,
             xmin = 50, xmax = Inf,
             ymin = 40, ymax = Inf)
```

## Another way to think about it

```{r}
p + annotate("rect", fill = nu_purple, alpha = 0.2,
             xmin = -Inf, xmax = 50,
             ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf)
```


## Causal statements

. . .

**Before:**

. . .

- Access to clean water and infant mortality are negatively correlated

. . .

**Now:**

::: incremental
- High access to clean water is **sufficient** for low infant mortality

- Low access to water is **necessary** for high infant mortality
:::

## Logic of causation

**Large N: Effect of causes**

::: incremental
- "What is the relationship between X and Y?"

- Focus on averages, associations

- Quantify uncertainty

- Impose assumptions for causal interpretation
:::

::: aside
See [Mahoney (2008)](https://doi.org/10.1177/0010414007313115) for more
:::

## Logic of causation

**Small N: Causes of effect**

::: incremental
- "Why did Y happen?"

- **Equifinality:** Multiple paths to the same outcome

- Focus on **causal mechanisms**
:::

See [Mahoney (2008)](https://doi.org/10.1177/0010414007313115) for more

## Equifinality

. . .

**Example: Paths to high economic growth**

. . .

1. Democracy AND industrialization AND rule of law

. . .

::: {.r-stack}
OR
:::

. . .

2. Democracy OR Autocracy AND natural resources



. . .

Multiple paths also imply **combinations of causes**

## Multiple causation

. . .

**INUS:** **I**nsufficient but **N**ecessary part of an **U**nnecessary but **S**ufficient set of conditions for the outcome

. . .

&nbsp;

**Example:** *Unprotected intercourse* is **insufficient** for *HIV transmission*, but it can be a **necessary** part in one of the ways in which HIV is transmitted

::: aside
aka **support factors**
:::

## Multiple causation

**SUIN:** **S**ufficient but **U**nnecessary part of a condition set that is **I**nsufficient but **N**ecessary for the outcome

. . .

&nbsp;

**Example:** *Electoral fraud* is a **sufficient** condition for *democratic erosion*, which in turn is a **neccessary** condition for war

::: aside
aka **precipitating causes**
:::


## Causal mechanism

. . .

> A process that explains **how** an outcome occurs.

. . .

Explaining **how** or **why** cause and effect are related entails identifying a **causal mechanism**

. . .

Large N relies **data set observations** (DSOs) that do not say much about the **mechanism**

. . .

Small N focuses on **causal process observations** (CPOs) that help us establish causation more directly

## Causal Process Observation

. . .

> An insight or piece of data that provides information about context, process, or mechanism, and that contributes distinctive leverage in causal inference.

## Causal Process Observation

> An insight or piece of data that provides information about context, process, or mechanism, and that contributes distinctive leverage in causal inference.

. . .

CPOs are not a real thing!

. . .

Neither are the assumptions we make in Large N!

. . .

We make assumptions not because they are true, but because they are useful
