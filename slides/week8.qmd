## So far

- Course mostly about **statistical** and **causal inference**

- **This week:** Small N or qualitative methods

- **Tuesday:** Reservations with large N + logic of causation

- [**Thursday:**](#thu) Case selection + techniques 

## Questions

What have you learned so far?

. . .

Any reservations with the methods we have discussed?

. . .

Any other methods you would like to learn about?

## Back to regression: QoG 2024

```{r, results = "hide"}
url = 'https://www.qogdata.pol.gu.se/data/qog_std_cs_jan24.csv'

qog = read.csv(url)

# examine but don't print in pdf
qog_am = qog %>% 
  select(cname,
         mortinf = wdi_mortinf,
         water = who_dwtot,
         elec = wdi_acel) %>% 
  drop_na()
```


```{r}
p = ggplot(qog_am) +
  aes(x = water, y = mortinf, label = cname) +
  geom_text(size = 4 ) +
  labs(
    x = "% Access to Clean Water",
    y = "Infant Mortality\n(per 1,000 births)"
  )

p
```

## Fit regression

```{r}
p + geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = nu_purple)
```


## More questions

::: incremental
- Can we claim *access to clean water* **reduces** *infant mortality*?

- What do we need to believe?

- Random assignment? Conditional independence? Quasi-experiment?

:::

. . .

**Critique 1:** *Correlation does not imply causation*

. . .

We need more knowledge to make causal claims

## Remove Turkmenistan

```{r}
p1 = p + geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = nu_purple)

p1
```

## Remove Turkmenistan

```{r}
ggplot(qog_am %>% filter(cname != "Turkmenistan")) +
  aes(x = water, y = mortinf, label = cname) +
  geom_text(size = 4 ) +
  labs(
    x = "% Access to Clean Water",
    y = "Infant Mortality\n(per 1,000 births)"
  ) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = nu_purple)
```

## Remove high infant mortality

```{r}
ggplot(qog_am %>% filter(cname != "Turkmenistan")) +
  aes(x = water, y = mortinf, label = cname) +
  geom_text(size = 4 ) +
  labs(
    x = "% Access to Clean Water",
    y = "Infant Mortality\n(per 1,000 births)"
  ) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = nu_purple)
```

## Remove high infant mortality

```{r}
ggplot(qog_am %>% filter(cname != "Turkmenistan" &
                           mortinf <= 50)) +
  aes(x = water, y = mortinf, label = cname) +
  geom_text(size = 4 ) +
  labs(
    x = "% Access to Clean Water",
    y = "Infant Mortality\n(per 1,000 births)"
  ) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = nu_purple) +
  ylim(0, 80)
```

## More more questions

. . .

Let's say you believe this relationship is causal

::: incremental
- How is it that one thing causes the other?

- Direction of causality?

- Is this true everywhere?

- Are we comparing apples and apples or apples and oranges and pick-up trucks?
:::

. . .

**Critique 2:** _Large N findings are what happens **on average**_

. . .

Averages are sensitive to **sample composition**

## Another way to think about it

```{r}
p
```

## Another way to think about it

```{r}
p + annotate("rect", fill = nu_purple, alpha = 0.2,
             xmin = 50, xmax = Inf,
             ymin = 40, ymax = Inf)
```

## Another way to think about it

```{r}
p + annotate("rect", fill = nu_purple, alpha = 0.2,
             xmin = -Inf, xmax = 50,
             ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf)
```


## Causal statements

. . .

**Before:**

. . .

- Access to clean water and infant mortality are negatively correlated

. . .

**Now:**

::: incremental
- High access to clean water is **sufficient** for low infant mortality

- Low access to water is **necessary** for high infant mortality
:::

## Logic of causation

**Large N: Effect of causes**

::: incremental
- "What is the relationship between X and Y?"

- Focus on averages, associations

- Quantify uncertainty

- Impose assumptions for causal interpretation
:::

::: aside
See [Mahoney (2008)](https://doi.org/10.1177/0010414007313115) for more
:::

## Logic of causation

**Small N: Causes of effect**

::: incremental
- "Why does Y happen?"

- **Equifinality:** Multiple paths to the same outcome

- Focus on **causal mechanisms**
:::

::: aside
See [Mahoney (2008)](https://doi.org/10.1177/0010414007313115) for more
:::

## Equifinality

. . .

**Example: Paths to high economic growth**

. . .

1. Democracy AND industrialization AND rule of law

. . .

::: {.r-stack}
OR
:::

. . .

2. Democracy OR Autocracy AND natural resources



. . .

Multiple paths also imply **combinations of causes**

## Multiple causation

. . .

**INUS:** **I**nsufficient but **N**ecessary part of an **U**nnecessary but **S**ufficient set of conditions for the outcome

. . .

&nbsp;

**Example:** *Unprotected intercourse* is **insufficient** for *HIV transmission*, but it can be a **necessary** part in one of the ways in which HIV is transmitted

::: aside
aka **support factors**
:::

## Multiple causation

**SUIN:** **S**ufficient but **U**nnecessary part of a condition set that is **I**nsufficient but **N**ecessary for the outcome

. . .

&nbsp;

**Example:** *Electoral fraud* is a **sufficient** condition for *democratic erosion*, which in turn is a **neccessary** condition for war

::: aside
aka **precipitating causes**
:::


## Causal mechanism

. . .

> A process that explains **how** an outcome occurs.

. . .

Explaining **how** or **why** cause and effect are related entails identifying a **causal mechanism**

. . .

Large N relies on **data set observations** (DSOs) that do not say much about the **mechanism**

. . .

Small N focuses on **causal process observations** (CPOs) that help us establish causation more directly

::: aside

## Causal Process Observation

. . .

> An insight or piece of data that provides information about context, process, or mechanism, and that contributes distinctive leverage in causal inference.

## Causal Process Observation

> An insight or piece of data that provides information about context, process, or mechanism, and that contributes distinctive leverage in causal inference.

. . .

CPOs are not a real thing!

. . .

Neither are the assumptions we make in Large N!

. . .

We make assumptions not because they are true, but because they are useful

## Case selection

. . .

We only need to look at a few cases to identify key CPOs

. . .

But how do we choose?

## Today: Case selection

. . .

**Large N:** Random sampling

. . .

Does it work here?

. . .

*Asymptotic properties* will not kick in with a few cases

. . .

Randomly chosen cases will not be *representative*

. . .

Need to sample intentionally!

## Case selection methods

1. Most similar

2. Most different

4. Extreme cases

3. Deviant case

5. Diverse cases

6. Influential cases

::: aside
See [Seawright and Gerring (2008)](https://doi.org/10.1177/1065912907313077) for more
:::

## Most similar

```{r}
most_similar = tribble(
  ~Case, ~`$X_1$`, ~`$X_2$`, ~`$Y$`,
  1, "+", "+", "+",
  2, "-", "+", "-"
)

options(tinytable_html_mathjax = TRUE)

most_similar %>% tt()
```

::: incremental
- Needs at least two cases

- Similar in every variable except for key explanatory and outcome variable

- **Example:** Economic development in South Korea and North Korea since the war
:::

## Most different

```{r}
most_diff = tribble(
  ~Case, ~`$X_1$`, ~`$X_2$`, ~`$Y$`,
  1, "+", "+", "+",
  2, "+", "-", "+"
)

options(tinytable_html_mathjax = TRUE)

most_diff %>% tt()
```

::: incremental
- Cases differ on everything except for key explanatory and outcome variable

- **Example:** Japan and Australia driving on the left
:::

## Typical case

::: incremental
- Common or representative case that a theory explains

- **Representative** by definition

- **Example:** France, Russia, China as *typical* cases of social revolutions

- Used to confirm causal mechanism proposed by the theory

- **Trap:** Usually, you don't want to look at a typical case **only**
:::

## Typical cases are "on the line"

```{r}
p1
```

## Extreme case

::: incremental
- Extreme value on explanatory OR outcome variable

- Far away from the "mean"

- Valuable because it is *rare* in one dimension


- **Example:** Qatar and Saudi Arabia as cases of extreme autocracy (Polity score of -10)
:::

## Deviant case

::: incremental
- Surprising value on some variable

- Poorly explained by the theory

- Used to explore potential alternative explanations

- Once explained, not deviant anymore

- **Example:** Norway as an oil-state that is not an autocracy
:::

## Diverse cases

::: incremental
- Choose cases to maximize variance along relevant dimensions

- At least two cases 

- Represent full range of values characterizing X and Y

- **Example:** Colonial heritage influences economic development. Look at French, Spanish, British colonies
:::

## Influential case

::: incremental

- **Concern:** results may be driven by one or a few cases

- Choose a case to check the assumptions behind proposed causal mechanism

- **Example:** Relationship between mass education and democratization *influenced* by countries who expanded education before becoming democracies
- 

:::

## Practice

```{r}
p1
```

## Moving on

. . .

Now we know how to select cases for small N analysis

. . .

But what do we do with these cases?

. . .

Or, what if we can only conduct **within-case analysis**?

## Qualitative methods

Ordered by increasing *level of immersion*

1. Process tracing

2. Interviews

3. Focus groups

4. Participant observation

5. Ethnography

```


::: aside
<https://youtu.be/5Z1hPH3b5RA?si=9sntmHBU5n_Ek1qG>
:::

## Process-tracing

::: incremental
- Usually based on **archival research**

- Extensive analysis of **primary** or **secondary** sources

- **Primary:** Original document or first-hand account

- **Secondary:** Summaries, critiques, opinions, analyses of those who did not participate or witness directly

- Find *pieces of evidence* that assist on *establishing causality*
:::

## Process tracing tests

![](fig/process_tracing.png){fig-align="center" width="80%"}

::: aside
See [Collier (2011)](https://polisci.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/people/u3827/Understanding%20Process%20Tracing.pdf) for more
:::

## Interviews

::: incremental
- **Structured:** Stick to script. Easy to compare across subjects

- **Semi-structured:** Start with guide, allow for deviations. Somewhat comparable

- **Unstructured:** Let people say whatever they want. Harder to compare and more time consuming to analyze
:::

. . .

**Key informants** more important than a **representative sample**

## Random sampling?

![](fig/sampling_types.png){fig-align="center"}

## Non-random sampling?

![](fig/nonrandom_sampling.png){fig-align="center"}

. . .

Places to start:

- Key informants

- Send out call on relevant platform

- Snowball sampling

## Focus groups

::: incremental
- Essentially an interview with multiple people in a controlled space

- Interactions in group discussion provide data

- Researcher acts as facilitator
:::

## Why focus groups?

```{=html}
<p align="center"><iframe width="900" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TYIh4MkcfJA?si=MEgy4lpGqWUEjCrp" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
```


::: aside
<https://youtu.be/TYIh4MkcfJA?si=pucARllaLPgLA3Bo>
:::

## Participant observation

::: incremental
- Researcher acts as an observer for an *extended period* of time

- Unlike focus groups, observe subjects *in their natural habitat*

- Must determine **level of involvement** and **whether to reveal identity**

:::

## Types of participant observation

```{r}
part_obs = tribble(
  ~Involvement, ~Overt, ~Covert,
  "Passive", "City hall meeting", "Public space, hidden camera",
  "Active", "Visiting rural areas", "Community center"
)

part_obs %>% tt() %>% 
  group_tt(
    j = list(
      "Identity" = 2:3
    )
  )
```


## Ethnography

::: incremental
- **Deep immersion** in a culture or community

- Combination of interviews, focus groups, participant observation

- **Thick description:** Produce vast amount of data (notes) to capture the complexity of behavior and its context
:::

## And I mean THICC

```{=html}
<p align="center"><iframe width="900" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3AhSNsBs2Y0?si=_R1TGfSgHxumhJ_E" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
```

<https://youtu.be/3AhSNsBs2Y0?si=ehUIf9COf9x9KAtz>
:::


## Positionality

. . .

> A person's social location and how it shapes their perspective

::: incremental

- Affects researcher's relationship with and access to participants

- **Large N:** Same protocol, same results

- **Small N:** Same protocol, *different* results

- Can be an advantage and a disadvantage
:::

## Summary

- Only one week on qualitative methods {{< fa regular face-sad-tear >}}

- Cause of effects vs. effects of causes

- **Inference:** Necessary and sufficient vs. correlational

- **Case-selection:** Avoid convenience traps!

- **Techniques:** Many available, often combined, but *positionality* matters
