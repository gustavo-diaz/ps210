## Last week

- Surveys and how to make them good

- Importance of random sampling to justify statistical inference via asymptotic properties (CLT)

- **So far:** Mostly about *descriptive statistics*

## This week

- Moving from *statistical inference* to *causal inference*

- Experiments as the *gold standard*

- **Tuesday:** Logic of experimentation

- [**Thursday:**](#thu) Learning from experiments

## Return to counterfactuals

## Making causal statements

::: incremental
- Why were we using cautious language?

- **Ideal study:** Compare the same man with and without smoking

- **Actual study:** Compare two *different* groups of men

. . .

No! we need some kind of **control**
