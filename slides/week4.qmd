- Uncertainty quantification (confidence intervals, p-values)

- **Keep in mind:** Statistical properties that enable inference (finite sample, asymptotic)

## Public opinion

::: incremental
- The study of *self-reported* **attitudes** and **behaviors**

- **Self-report:** What people *say*

- **Attitude:** What people *think* or *feel*

- **Behavior:** What people *do*

- Primarily among the *general public*

- Increasingly on specific *target populations*
:::

. . .

 **Goal:** Mapping **self-reports** to **actual** attitudes and behaviors

::: {style="text-align: center"}
## Open question {.center}

. . .

Should political scientist care about **attitudes** on their own?

. . .

Do we only care about **behaviors**?

There is a gap between *self-reports* and *actual* attitudes/behaviors

::::

## Sampling procedure

. . .

**_Ideal case_: Random sampling**

. . .

**Simple random sampling:** All units have the same inclusion probability ($\approx$ flipping a coin for each)

. . .

**Complete random sampling:**  *Exactly* $n$ out of $N$ units are selected at random ($\approx$ arrange in random order and then survey the first $n$)

. . .

&nbsp;

::: {.r-stack}
How are these different?
:::

## Why is random sampling important?

. . .

**Informally:** So that our sample is (in expectation) *representative* of the target population

. . . 

**Formally:** To justify statistical inference via CLT

. . .

We need to assume that the observations in our sample are drawn from...

... data generation processes

. . .

This is known as the **i.i.d assumption**

## i.i.d. implications

. . . 

Each survey respondent has an internal, unobservable **function** that draws different survey responses with some probability

. . .

**Independent:** How *I* come up with answers does not affect how *you* come up with answers

. . .

**Identically distributed:** 

::: incremental
- Do not know how responses are drawn

- Assume is the same process for everyone
:::

::: aside
We call these *unobservable functions* [random variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_variable)
:::


## i.i.d. implications

This is equivalent to assuming that individual units are sampled at random **with replacement**

![](fig/sampling_replacement.webp){fig-align="center"}

## i.i.d. implications

This is equivalent to assuming that individual units are sampled at random **with replacement**

But we can only do random sampling *without replacement*

. . .

**Random sampling** lets us justify the **i.i.d. assumption**, which in turn allows using the standard formula for **confidence intervals** and **p-values**.

# gss22 %>% select(hispanic). 1 not, else some category
# gss22 %>% select(degree). 1 HS, 2 or more some post-sec

# Question: 
# Do you remember for sure whether or not you voted in the last election?
gss = gss22 %>% 
  select(vote20, sexnow1, hispanic, degree) %>% 
  mutate(vote = ifelse(vote20 == 1, "yes", "no"),
         sex = case_when(

  drop_na() %>% 
  select(vote, sex, hispanic, college)
```

```{r}
gss %>% print(n = 5000)

. . .

$\rightarrow$ Take this as a population and compare different sampling procedures

## Variants of random sampling

::: incremental
- **Stratified random sampling:** Complete random simpling within groups/strata

```

. . .

$\rightarrow$ Less likely to get unlucky!

## Non-random sampling

- **Convenience sampling:** Easy, inexpensive access

:::

## More practice

. . . 

Q: *What is the most important thing to teach children to prepare them for life?*

. . . 

A: **To think for themselves**

. . .

- 61.5% multiple choice
- 4.6% open-ended


## What makes a good survey question?

. . . 

No definitive answer!

. . . 

- We want some validity and reliability, but those are hard to gauge

. . . 

- Consistency over time is good

. . .

Here are some vague principles

## Literal vs. pragmatic meaning

. . .

What the words mean vs. what we think the question is asking

. . .

Follow the *maxims of conversation*:

::: incremental
1. **Maxim of relation:** Answers are relevant *relative* to context

2. **Maxim of quantity:** Answer are informative, but no more informative than required

3. **Maxim of manner:** Most obvious meaning should be the correct one

4. **Maxim of quality:** Not to say anything false or inaccurate
:::

. . .

Try to approximate everyday language!

## Open-ended vs. closed response

. . .

Q: *What have you done today?*

. . . 

What to say if **open-ended**:

::: incremental
- I went to class

- I took a shower

- I read the newspaper

- I wrote to my representative
:::

## Open-ended vs. closed response



Q: *What have you done today?*


What to say if **multiple choice**:

- I went to class

- I took a shower

- I read the newspaper

- I wrote to my representative


## Frequency scales

Q: *How frequently have you felt really irritated?*

. . .

What does *really irritated* mean?

. . .

Maybe look at the options:

. . .

- Less than once a year

- About twice per year

- Every other month

- About once a month

- More than once a month



## Reference periods

Q: _How many times have you felt really irritated **this year**_

vs.
:::

. . .

Q: _How many times have you felt really irritated **last week?**_

## Rating scales

. . .

Q: *How successful would you say you have been in life?*

. . .

**Scale 1**

0 (Not at all successful) - 10 (extremely successful)

. . .

**Scale 2**

-5 (Not at all successful) - 5 (extremely succesful)

## Rating scales


Q: *How successful would you say you have been in life?*

**Scale 1** (13% between 0 and 5)

0 (Not at all successful) - 10 (extremely successful)


**Scale 2** (34% between -5 and 0)

-5 (Not at all successful) - 5 (extremely succesful)

&nbsp;

. . .

But the questions *themselves*?

:::



## Some examples

::: incremental
- Have you lied about having COVID symptoms?

- Would you bribe a police officer to avoid a traffic ticket?

- Have you had sex after drinking alcohol?

- Have you been offered goods or favors for your vote?

- Do you know anyone with links to a militant organization?

- Would you oppose a black family moving next door?

- Would you allow muslim immigrants to become citizens?

:::

## What do these have in common?

::: incremental
- They are **sensitive questions**

- We can only learn about them through surveys

- Asking about them directly leads to **misreporting**

- This kind of *measurement error is called* **social desirability bias** or **sensitivity bias**
:::

## How to reduce sensitivity bias?

::: incremental

- Purposefully deviate from *maxims of conversation*

- By adding noise to the question

- Two approaches:

1. Distract from the sensitive attitude/behavior

2. Guarantee anonymity

- Different techniques vary on how they combine the two

- Broadly known as **indirect questioning techniques**

Now, during the height of the conflict in 2007 and 2008 *(in Afghanistan)*, did you know any militants, like a family member, a friend, or someone you talked to on a regular basis? 

. . .

Please, before you answer, take note of the number you rolled on the dice.

## How does it work?

::: incremental

- We know that about $1/6 \approx 0.17$ respondents said *yes* because they rolled a {{< fa dice-six >}}

- So if $30\%$ in total said *yes*

- We have $\widehat{Y} = 0.3 - 0.17 = 0.13$ as our *population estimate*

- But we **do not know** who they are in our survey!

- Respondents are randomly assigned to conditions

- Differences in responses can only be attributed to the presence/absence of the sensitive item (more on this in next week)
