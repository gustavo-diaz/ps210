## Last week

Ingredients for **statistical inference**

- Data summary (point estimate, test statistic)

- Uncertainty quantification (confidence intervals, p-values)

- **Keep in mind:** Statistical properties that enable inference (finite sample, asymptotic)

## This week: Surveys

**Survey research:** Study of public opinion

. . .

Not really a *method*, more of a *data collection tool*

. . .

**Tuesday:** Sampling

::: incremental
1. Why random sampling?

2. Sources of error
:::

. . .

**Thursday:** Survey design

::: incremental
1. Asking good questions

2. Asking sensitive questions

## Public opinion

::: incremental
- The study of *self-reported* **attitudes** and **behaviors**

- **Self-report:** What people *say*

- **Attitude:** What people *think* or *feel*

- **Behavior:** What people *do*

- Primarily among the *general public*

- Increasingly on specific *target populations*
:::

. . .

 **Goal:** Mapping **self-reports** to **actual** attitudes and behaviors

::: {style="text-align: center"}
## Open question {.center}

. . .

Should political scientist care about **attitudes** on their own?

. . .

Do we only care about **behaviors**?

:::

## Challenge

. . .

There is a gap between *self-reports* and *actual* attitudes/behaviors

. . . 

Two things get in the way:

::: incremental

1. Asking the right people

2. Asking the right questions

## Key sampling decisions


1. **Mode**

2. **Sampling frame**

3. ~~Sample size~~

4. **Sampling procedure**

5. ~~Oversampling~~


## Survey mode

::: incremental
- **Face-to-face:** Oldest, most common method in US national and cross-national surveys

- **Laboratory:** Few people, more intricate tasks

- **Phone:** Groundbreaking at the time, but less reliable nowadays

- **Internet:** Online panels ([CloudResearch Connect](https://www.cloudresearch.com/products/connect-for-researchers/), [Mturk](https://www.mturk.com), [Prolific](https://www.prolific.com/researchers)), social media ads, message app chains
:::

. . .

National representative surveys usually combine many modes

- *Common sampling frames:* Phone books, electoral rolls, employee databases, household directories

- *Ideal case:* [Danish Civil Registry](https://ncrr.au.dk/danish-registers/the-danish-civil-registration-system-cpr)

- *{{< fa fire >}} take:* We neve *really* know what the *target population* is

## Sampling procedure

. . .

**_Ideal case_: Random sampling**

. . .

**Simple random sampling:** All units have the same inclusion probability ($\approx$ flipping a coin for each)

. . .

**Complete random sampling:**  *Exactly* $n$ out of $N$ units are selected at random ($\approx$ arrange in random order and then survey the first $n$)

. . .

&nbsp;

::: {.r-stack}
How are these different?
:::

## Why is random sampling important?

. . .

**Informally:** So that our sample is (in expectation) *representative* of the target population

. . . 

**Formally:** To justify statistical inference via CLT

. . .

We need to assume that the observations in our sample are drawn from...

. . .

... data generation processes

. . .

This is known as the **i.i.d assumption**

## i.i.d. implications

. . . 

Each survey respondent has an internal, unobservable **function** that draws different survey responses with some probability

. . .

**Independent:** How *I* come up with answers does not affect how *you* come up with answers

. . .

**Identically distributed:** 
::: incremental
- Do not know how responses are drawn

- Assume is the same process for everyone
:::

::: aside
We call these *unobservable functions* [random variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_variable)
:::


## i.i.d. implications

This is equivalent to assuming that individual units are sampled at random **with replacement** 

---

![](fig/sampling_replacement.webp){fig-align="center"}

## i.i.d. implications

This is equivalent to assuming that individual units are sampled at random **with replacement** 

. . .

But we can only do random sampling *without replacement*

. . .

$\rightarrow$ A decent approximation if sample size is large enough

. . . 

::: {.callout-important}

**Random sampling** allows to justify the **i.i.d. assumption**, which in turn lets us use the standard formula for **confidence intervals** and **p-values**.
