:::

## Last time

. . .

This is a course about **Political Science** research methods

::: incremental
1. **Politics:** Power relationships across many subfields
2. **Science:** Knowledge generation through falsification
:::

## Informally

. . .

Some philosophers may think "Political Science" is an *oxymoron*

::: incremental
1. **Politics:** Normative statements about what's good for the *polity*
2. **Science:** True, unquestionable knowledge
:::

. . .

Can there be a **SCIENCE** of **POLITICS**?

## The goal of science

::: incremental
- **Inference:** Use *what we know* to learn about *what we do not know*

- **Key:** Try to prove ourselves wrong, even if we believe we are right (*falsification*)

- Scientific statements are **falsifiable**
:::

## Scientific statement

. . .

A **meaningful**

::: aside
Definition from [Clark, Golder, and Golder (2024). "Principles of Comparative Politics." CQ Press.](https://collegepublishing.sagepub.com/products/principles-of-comparative-politics-4-259276) Chapter 2.
:::

## Scientific statement

A **meaningful declarative** sentence

::: aside
Definition from [Clark, Golder, and Golder (2024). "Principles of Comparative Politics." CQ Press.](https://collegepublishing.sagepub.com/products/principles-of-comparative-politics-4-259276) Chapter 2.
:::

## Scientific statement

A **meaningful declarative** sentence that is **unambiguously true or false**.

::: aside
Definition from [Clark, Golder, and Golder (2024). "Principles of Comparative Politics." CQ Press.](https://collegepublishing.sagepub.com/products/principles-of-comparative-politics-4-259276) Chapter 2.
:::

::: incremental
- **Meaningful:** We agree on its interpretation

- **Declarative:** Claims or asserts something

- **Unambiguously true or false:** One or the other, but not both or neither (therefore refutable or falsifiable)
:::

## Unscientific statements

::: incremental
- Triangles have three sides

- Political science is the study of politics

- God created the world

- Edison created the lightbulb
:::

## Unscientific statements

Two types:

. . .

1. Tautologies
2. Unobservable phenomena

. . .

**Important:** non-science $\neq$ nonsense

## Reminder

. . .

**Scientific statements** are true or false

**Scientific knowledge/evidence** is neither

. . . 

Why?

. . .

How do you **evaluate** a scientific statement?

## The scientific method

**Step 0:** Puzzle/Question

**Step 1:** Theory/Model

**Step 2:** Hypothesis/Implications

**Step 3:** Observation/Testing

**Step 4:** Conclusion/Evaluation

## Practice

![](fig/nu_sing_study.png){fig-align="center" width="90%"}

::: aside
<https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2025/04/virtual-singing-brings-connection-and-joy-to-isolated-older-adults-study-finds/>
:::

## Details

> In collaboration with Illinois-based Sounds Good Choir, the study assessed the feasibility of virtual group singing for adults over 55 — including those with neurocognitive disorders like dementia — during the COVID-19 pandemic when older adults were experiencing health declines due to isolation. It found virtual group singing can be an effective tool for promoting well-being and social connection during isolation.

::: aside
<https://doi.org/10.1177/13872877251333155>
:::

## Findings

> Participants in the group choir during the pandemic consistently described the activity as providing a sense of normalcy amid widespread disruption — a theme that emerged prominently and merits further investigation.

. . .

> This suggests that such interventions may help restore a feeling of normalcy, supporting psychological well-being and offering a means of reconnecting with a stable sense of self.

<https://doi.org/10.1177/13872877251333155>
:::

## Breaking it apart

. . .

**Question:** Can singing help overcome isolation?

. . .

**Theory:** Choral singing is a therapeutic activity for individuals with neurological disorders

. . .

**Hypothesis:** Individuals who sing in a choir will report higher levels of well-being than those who do not

. . .

**Test:** Organize virtual group choir, ask survey questions in the end

. . .

**Conclusion:** "Isolated older adults find joy and connection through virtual singing"

## Limitations?

. . .

**Ideal study**

. . .

Observe person $i$'s well-being with and without singing, everything else constant

. . .


**Actual study**

- Adults 55 an older in Chicago

- Elected to participate

- Two teleconferencing programs

- 176 survey responses out of 695 participants

## Problem {.center}

. . .

Cannot observe the ideal counterfactual

. . .

Any test/evidence can only be **suggestive**

## Testing theories

::: incremental
- Cannot test **theories** because they are **statements**

- Need to **believe** theory is true to engage with it scientifically

- Instead, test **arguments** that follow from a theory (hypotheses, implications)
:::

. . .

**Valid argument:** Accepting it *compels us* to accept conclusion

**Invalid argument:** Accepting it *frees us* from accepting/rejecting conclusion

## Scientific critiques

. . .

**Valid critiques** to **valid arguments** fall in *three categories*

::: incremental
1. **Omitted variable:** Having a friend network leads to both choral singing and well-being

2. **Reverse causation:** Improvements in well-being lead to choral singing

3. **Selection bias:** Only people who would benefit from choral signing sign up for it
:::

## Scientific critiques

A valid critique implies:

::: incremental
1. Observed implications also follow from **alternative theories**

2. **Cannot falsify** theory

3. Need to find **better implications** to distinguish among competing theories
:::

## Scientific critiques

**Scientist's dilemma:**

::: incremental
- When evidence supports hypothesis, your theory is ~~accepted~~ **not rejected**
- When evidence *does not* support hypothesis, your theory is ~~rejected~~ **not accepted**
- No such thing as *definitive* knowledge
- Future research can always flip things around!
:::


## Takeaways

1. Science differs from other forms of knowledge generation in that we try really hard to prove ourselves wrong
2. Scientific statements/arguments are falsifiable
3. We never observe the ideal counterfactual
4. We can only test a few implications of a theory at a time
5. Findings can align with many alternative theories
