A *scientific theory* 

## Textbook definition

A *scientific theory* is a set of **logically consistent statements** 

## Textbook definition

A *scientific theory* is a set of **logically consistent statements** that tell us **why** the empirical social and political phenomena we observe, or the relationships between them, **occur in the way they occur**

. . . 

A theory is a **set of interrelated propositions** about empirical reality

. . .

Components:

::: incremental
1. **Concepts** that define basic terms

2. **Assumptions** that relate concepts to each other

3. **Generalizations** that connect statements to observations
:::



## Toy example: Democratic peace

. . .

**Proposition:** Democracies are hesitant to fight each other

. . . 

**Concepts:**

::: incremental
- *Democracy*: Leaders elected in free-fair elections
- *Fighting*: Militarized Interstate Disputes (MID)
:::

. . .

**Assumptions:**

::: incremental
- Liberal democratic culture of negotiation and compromise
- Democratic publics dislike wars
:::
. . .

**Generalization:** No war between democracies

provokes the 'fight' response (Frijda, 1986) and that anger is
a contagious emotion (Schacter and Singer, 1962; Baron,

> Recent empirical evidence suggests that the collective bargaining process, the union-management contract , and union-management relations in general all have important consequences for the quality of worklife of unionized workers. Moreover, previous work has investigated the relationship between union strength and construction workers' reactions to their work. She found that union strength (operationalized in terms of workers' relative wages) was positively related to both pay satisfaction and perceived job security. Finally, the union's ability to formally increase members' participation in job-related decisions has been frequently cited as contributing to the unionization of teachers and other professionals.

## Nuance traps

. . .

1. **Nuance of the _fine-grain_**

. . .

Theory as *extremely detailed* description of the world

. . .

2. **Nuance of the _conceptual framework_**

<!-- e.g. social action theory -->

. . .

Expansion of an *irrefutable theoretical system*

. . .

3. **Nuance of the _connoiseur_**

. . .

Nuanced theory as a sign of *sophistication*

Good theories explain more than what they assume

## Summary

1. Theory is logical explanation or informed speculation

2. Theories explain why we observe what we observe

3. It feels complicated because

    - Good theorizing is hard
    - Pressure to always say something new

## In empirical research

The term *data* is used in two ways:

. . .

1. Data as *information*

. . .

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
> "The data suggests that inflation keeps growing"
:::

. . . 


2. Data as the *raw material* from which we draw inferences


. . .

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}

:::




2. **Data as the *raw material* from which we draw inferences**

. . .

The second is more correct since "data doesn't speak."

## Data usually comes as a rectangle

```{r}
table1 %>% tt()
```

. . .

We call this a **dataset**, **dataframe**, or **database**

## Elements of a dataset

. . .

A single *observation* is a scalar

$$a = 12$$

. . .

Several scalars together make a vector


$$
\overrightarrow b = \begin{bmatrix}
  12 & 14 & 15
\end{bmatrix}
$$

## Elements of a dataset

Vectors have *direction*

. . .

This is a **row** vector

$$
\overrightarrow b = \begin{bmatrix}
  12 & 14 & 15
\end{bmatrix}
$$

. . .

This is a **column** vector

$$
\overrightarrow c = 
\begin{bmatrix}
  12 \\
  14 \\
  15
\end{bmatrix}
$$


## Elements of a dataset

Several vectors of equal length make a **matrix**

$$A = \begin{bmatrix}
12 & 14 & 15 \\
115 & 22 & 127 \\
193 & 29 & 219
\end{bmatrix}$$

. . .

The number of *rows* and *columns* are the **dimensions**

. . .

This is a $3 \times 3$ matrix ($r \times c$)

## A dataset is just a matrix with labels

table1 %>% tt()

## Types of variables


::: incremental
1. **Nominal/categorical:** Cannot be ordered in any way
2. **Ordinal:** Ordered
3. **Numerical:** Ordered + equidistant
:::

. . .

EMPS further distinguishes numerical variables:

::: incremental
1. **Discrete:** Countable integers
2. **Continuous:** Infinitesimally uncountable, real numbers
:::

. . .

But technically everything numerical is discrete!

## Practice

. . .

**[Varieties of Democracy](https://www.v-dem.net)'s _regime type_ measure:**

. . .

0: Closed autocracy -- No multiparty elections

. . .

1: Electoral autocracy -- De-jure elections but not free and fair

. . .

2: Electoral democracy -- Free and fair elections with some flaws

. . .

3: Liberal democracy -- Free and fair elections guaranteed
