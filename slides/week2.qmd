## The Scientific Method { .center}

### POLI SCI 210

Introduction to Empirical Methods in Political Science

:::

## Lingering questions

::: incremental
- About syllabus?
- Canvas?
- Assignments?
- Grading?
- Readings?
- Office hours?
- Anything?

:::

## Last time

. . .

This is a course about **Political Science** research methods

::: incremental
1. **Politics:** Power relationships across many subfields
2. **Science:** Knowledge generation through falsification
:::

## Informally

. . .

Some philosophers may think "Political Science" is an *oxymoron*

::: incremental
1. **Politics:** Normative statements about what's good for the *polity*
2. **Science:** True, unquestionable knowledge
:::

. . .

Can there be a **SCIENCE** of **POLITICS**?

## The goal of science

::: incremental
- **Inference:** Use *what we know* to learn about *what we do not know*

- **Key:** Try to prove ourselves wrong, even if we believe we are right (*falsification*)

- Scientific statements are **falsifiable**
:::

## Scientific statement

. . .

A **meaningful**

## Scientific statement

A **meaningful declarative** sentence

:::

## Scientific statement

A **meaningful declarative** sentence that is **unambiguously true or false**.

::: aside
Definition from [Clark, Golder, and Golder (2024). "Principles of Comparative Politics." CQ Press.](https://collegepublishing.sagepub.com/products/principles-of-comparative-politics-4-259276) Chapter 2.
:::

::: incremental
- **Meaningful:** We agree on its interpretation

- **Declarative:** Claims or asserts something

- **Unambiguously true or false:** One or the other, but not both or neither (therefore refutable or falsifiable)
:::

## Unscientific statements

::: incremental
- Triangles have three sides

- Political science is the study of politics

- God created the world

- Edison created the lightbulb
:::

## Unscientific statements

Two types:

. . .

1. Tautologies
2. Unobservable phenomena

. . .

**Important:** non-science $\neq$ nonsense

## Reminder

. . .

**Scientific statements** are true or false

**Scientific knowledge/evidence** is neither

. . . 

Why?

. . .

How do you **evaluate** a scientific statement?

## The scientific method

**Step 0:** Puzzle/Question

**Step 1:** Theory/Model

**Step 2:** Hypothesis/Implications

**Step 3:** Observation/Testing

**Step 4:** Conclusion/Evaluation

## Practice

**Puzzle/question:** Does marijuana cause infertility?

**Theory:** THC kills cells

**Hypothesis:** Male smokers have lower semen volume than non-smokers

**Test:** Bring men to lab, ask if they smoke, measure sperm, ask if they smoke, compare

**Conclusion:** "Study by Tulane researcher **SUGGESTS** marijuana **CAN** cause infertility in men"

## Why the cautious language?

. . .

We want to know the **counterfactual**: Person A's fertility with and without marijuana *consumption*

. . . 

But we can only compare **smokers** to **non-smokers**

. . . 

This is the **fundamental problem of causal inference** (more in week 5)

## Why the cautious language?

Also...

::: incremental
- Only men
- Undergoing fertility evaluation
- In *one* urology clinic in Washington state
- 409 total, 71 current smokers (17%), 103 past smokers (25%)
:::



## Testing theories

::: incremental
- Cannot test **theories** because they are **statements**

- Need to **believe** theory is true to engage with it scientifically

- Instead, test **arguments** that follow from a theory (hypotheses, implications)
:::

. . .

**Valid argument:** Accepting it *compels us* to accept conclusion

**Invalid argument:** Accepting premises *frees us* from accepting/rejecting conclusion

## Scientific critiques

. . .

**Valid critiques** to **valid arguments** fall in *three categories*

::: incremental
1. **Omitted variable:** Stress leads men to smoke marijuana AND to become infertile

2. **Reverse causation:** Infertility causes men to smoke marijuana

3. **Selection bias:** Men who smoke marijuana wait longer before going consulting a doctor
:::

## Scientific critiques

A valid critique implies:

::: incremental
1. Observed implications also follow from **alternative theories**

2. **Cannot falsify** theory

3. Need to find **better implications** to distinguish among competing theories
:::

## Scientific critiques

**Scientist's dilemma:**

::: incremental
- When evidence supports hypothesis, your theory is ~~accepted~~ **not rejected**
- When evidence *does not* support hypothesis, your theory is ~~rejected~~ **not accepted**
- No such thing as *definitive* knowledge
- Future research can always flip things around!
:::



## Takeaways

1. Science differs from other forms of knowledge generation in that we try really hard to prove ourselves wrong
2. Scientific statements/arguments are falsifiable
3. We never observe the ideal counterfactual
4. We can only test a few implications of a theory at a time
5. Findings can align with many alternative theories

## Next week: Theory and data

**EMPS Chapters 3-4**

- What is a theory? What is a good theory?

- Different types of data/variables

**Application: Billionaire politicians**

- Think about the decisions that were made to define and measure this category
