### POLI SCI 210

Introduction to Empirical Methods in Political Science

:::

## Lingering questions

::: incremental
- Course organization?
- Assignments/grading?
- Material?
:::

## General roadmap

::: incremental
- **Weeks 1-2:** Build common language to talk about different methods

- **Week 3 onward:** Talk about different methods and when/why/how they are useful or important
:::

## Last week: The scientific method

**Step 0:** Puzzle/Question

**Step 1:** Theory/Model

**Step 2:** Hypothesis/Implications

**Step 3:** Observation/Testing

**Step 4:** Conclusion/Evaluation

## This week

**Step 0:** Puzzle/Question

**Step 1:** Theory/Model

**Step 2:** Hypothesis/Implications

**Step 3:** Observation/Testing

## But it sure is important!

. . .

Most common reasons why a peer-reviewed political science journal rejects an article:

::: incremental
1. Having no theory
2. Weak theory
3. Insufficient theoretical innovation

## Dictionary definitions

::: incremental
1. A **belief** that can **guide behavior**

2. A **well-substantiated explanation** of some aspect of the natural world; an **organized system of accepted knowledge** that **applies in a variety of circumstances** to **explain a specific set of phenomena**

3. A **tentative insight** into the natural world; a concept that is **not yet verified** but that if true **would explain certain facts or phenomena**

## Textbook definition

. . .

A *scientific theory* 

## Textbook definition

A *scientific theory* is a set of **logically consistent statements** 

## Textbook definition

A *scientific theory* is a set of **logically consistent statements** that tell us **why** the empirical social and political phenomena we observe, or the relationships between them, **occur in the way they occur**

. . . 

A theory is a **set of interrelated propositions** about empirical reality

. . .

Components:

::: incremental
1. **Concepts** that define basic terms

2. **Assumptions** that relate concepts to each other

3. **Generalizations** that connect statements to observations
:::



## Toy example: Democratic peace

. . .

**Proposition:** Democracies are hesitant to fight each other

. . . 

**Concepts:**

::: incremental
- *Democracy*: Leaders elected in free-fair elections
- *Fighting*: Militarized Interstate Disputes (MID)
:::

. . .

**Assumptions:**

::: incremental
- Liberal democratic culture of negotiation and compromise
- Democratic publics dislike wars
:::
. . .

**Generalization:** No war between democracies

## References are not theory

. . .

Literature A suggests X.

## References are not theory

Literature A suggests X. Literature B says Y.

## References are not theory

Literature A suggests X. Literature B says Y. Borrowing from both, we should expect XYZ.

::: incremental
- Referencing theories in previous work helps to contextualize new explanations
- But often used as a smokescreen for no theory

> This pattern is consistent with findings that aggression
provokes the 'fight' response (Frijda, 1986) and that anger is
a contagious emotion (Schacter and Singer, 1962; Baron,
1977).

## Data is not theory

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
> Recent empirical evidence suggests that the collective bargaining process, the union-management contract , and union-management relations in general all have important consequences for the quality of worklife of unionized workers. Moreover, previous work has investigated the relationship between union strength and construction workers' reactions to their work. She found that union strength (operationalized in terms of workers' relative wages) was positively related to both pay satisfaction and perceived job security. Finally, the union's ability to formally increase members' participation in job-related decisions has been frequently cited as contributing to the unionization of teachers and other professionals.

## Also not theories

::: incremental
- **Lists of variables or concepts:** Do not explain why

- **Models or paradigms:** Simplify, but do not explain (e.g. rational choice)

- **Hypotheses:** Translate theory to expectations

Theory is either:

Theory is either:

1. **Logical** explanation

2. speculation

## Honestly

Theory is either:

1. **Logical** explanation

2. **Informed** speculation

**Real question:** What makes a good theory?

## Good theories

::: incremental
- Give a **new** explanation

- Give a **different** explanation

- Not too different to sound like **non-sense**

- But different enough to try to change your mind

:::

. . .

**Trap:** Pressure to say something new leads to overly complicated theories

. . .

**Rule of thumb:** Good theories explain more than what they assume
