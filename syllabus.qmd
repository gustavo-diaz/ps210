# Grading

This course uses a labor-based grading agreement, commonly known as contract grading. In this course, instead of being given a final grade based on how “good” your submitted assignments are, your final grade will be based on the amount of labor you put into the course. The goal is to decouple grades from performance and emphasize learning and effort.
